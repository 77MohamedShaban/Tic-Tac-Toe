flutter_native_splash:
  # This package generates native code to customize Flutter's default white native splash screen
  # with background color and splash image.
  # Steps to make this work:
  # 1. Customize the parameters below.
  # 2. run the following command in the terminal:
  # dart run flutter_native_splash:create
  # or if you place this not in pubspec.yaml and not in flutter_native_splash.yaml:
  # dart run flutter_native_splash:create -p ../your-filepath.yaml
  # 3. voila, done!

  # NOTES:
  # - in case you got some trouble, cleaning up flutter project might help:
  # flutter clean ; flutter pub get
  # - To restore Flutter's default white splash screen, run the following command in the terminal:
  # dart run flutter_native_splash:remove
  # or if you place this not in pubspec.yaml and not in flutter_native_splash.yaml:
  # dart run flutter_native_splash:remove -p ../your-filepath.yaml

  # IMPORTANT NOTE: These parameter do not affect the configuration of Android 12 and later, which
  # handle splash screens differently that prior versions of Android.  Android 12 and later must be
  # configured specifically in the android_12 section below, at the very end.

  #======================================================================

  # uncomment this if you want to disable this package for specific platform:
  # android: false
  # ios: false
  # web: false

  #======================================================================

  #! FOR ALL PLATFORM, except Android 12+:

  # general color for all platform (except android 12+):
  # see there only 2 lines in all parameters that marked as [required], so others
  # remain optional. NOTE that if you specify the [required] color, then you cant
  # use the [required] background_image in the next section. the reverse is true.
  # select one, they cant work together.
  color: "#FFFFFF"  ##====================================[REQUIRED]==========
  fullscreen: true
  android_12:
    # background color
    color: "#FFFFFF"
